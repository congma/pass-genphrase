With due gratitude, the following authors' contributions are acknowledged.

* Jason A. Donenfeld
 - Creator of "pass", or Password Store, the password manager.  This program
   (pass-genphrase) only makes sense when used as part of "pass".
 - The code of this program closely follows that of "pass".  Portions are used
   directly from the "pass" source code in a bid to maximize compatibility.

* Joseph Bonneau / The Electronic Frontier Foundation
 - Creator of the default dictionary used by this program, the EFF Long Word
   List.

* Arnold G. Reinhold
 - Creator of Diceware (tm) and the Diceware English Wordlist.  The English
   Wordlist is used as part of the test suite and an alternative passphrase
   dictionary.
 - Diceware inspired similar passphrase generation tools, including this
   program.

* Vladimír Sedmík
 - Creator of the original Diceware Czech Wordlist.  A modified version of the
   Czech Wordlist (with the BOM removed) is used as part of the test suite and
   an alternative passphrase dictionary.

* Alexandre Pujol and Contributors to "pass-update", and
* Tad Fisher and Contributors to "pass-otp"
 - Their work on pass extensions has been studied while writing this program.

* Vanya Klimenko
 - Contributor of the "--no-spaces" option.
