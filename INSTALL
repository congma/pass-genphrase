Local install (recommended)
---------------------------

Local install means copying the extension's files to the user's own Password
Store storage dictionary.  This is the recommended installation method.

To perform local installation, type the command:

	make install

The following procedure determines the path of installation:

    1.  If the variable `PASSWORD_STORE_EXTENSIONS_DIR' is set, it is used as
        the destination of file copying.
    2.  Otherwise, check the variable `PASSWORD_STORE_DIR'.  If it is set,
        `PASSWORD_STORE_DIR/.extensions' is used as the destination.
    3.  Otherwise, the directory `~/.password-store/.extensions' is used.

(See the manual of pass(1) for the rationale.)

NOTE:  Under the local install mode, the manual page will not be installed.

NOTE:  To use locally installed extensions, the environment variable
`PASSWORD_STORE_ENABLE_EXTENSIONS' must be set to the exact string `true'.


Global install
--------------

Globally installed extensions can be used by any user without setting the
`PASSWORD_STORE_ENABLE_EXTENSIONS' environment variable.

For global install, it's necessary to set the `PREFIX' variable for `make', and
the value should point to the prefix directory of the `pass' installation.  The
Makefile will not try to be so smart as to guess the copy destination.

For example, if `pass' is installed as `/usr/local/bin/pass', the correct
PREFIX should likely be `/usr/local'.

By default, if `PREFIX' is not set, `/usr' is used.

To install this extension globally, use the command

	make globalinstall

with suitable privileges.  The `PREFIX' variable can be specified as an
environment variable, for example, by

	PREFIX=/usr make globalinstall

or as a command line argument to `make', for example, by

	make PREFIX=/usr globalinstall

Another example, on Mac OS X (macOS) with `pass' installed from Homebrew:

	make PREFIX="$(brew --prefix)" globalinstall


Uninstallation
--------------

There are two uninstallation commands,

	make uninstall

and
	make globaluninstall,

each for the respective installation mode.  To uninstall globallly, one should
also set the `PREFIX' variable.

Uninstalling this extension does not affect the stored passphrases.
